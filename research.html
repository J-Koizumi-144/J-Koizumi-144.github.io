        <h3>1. Zeroth \(\mathbb{A}^1\)-homology of smooth proper varieties</h3>
        <p class="journal">New York J. Math. 28 (2022), 824–834. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04951">arXiv: 2101.04951</a></p>
        <p>This was the first paper I wrote during my master's program. The \(\mathbb{A}^1\)-homology is a computationally difficult object defined via a universal property. However, I realized that in the smooth and proper case, it can actually be computed formally using just this universality. Writing this paper gave me confidence that I could do meaningful research of my own.</p>

        <h3>2. Steinberg symbols and reciprocity sheaves</h3>
        <p class="journal">Annals of K-Theory 7:4 (2022), 695–730. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04163">arXiv: 2108.04163</a></p>
        <p>My master's thesis. I was inspired by the result of Hu and Kriz, which explains the Steinberg relation \((a, 1-a) = 0\) in \(K\)-theory through \(\mathbb{A}^1\)-homotopy theory. Motivated by this, I tried to find an analogue for \(\Omega^q\). At the time, there was no established category of motives suited to additive symbols, so the formulation I arrived at is somewhat unnatural.</p>

        <h3>3. A motivic construction of the de Rham-Witt complex (with H. Miyazaki)</h3>
        <p class="journal">Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra 228 (6), 107602. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05846">arXiv: 2301.05846</a></p>
        <p>The first part of my Ph.D. thesis. I was fascinated by the idea that Milnor \(K\)-theory can be seen as a tensor product of the motive of \(\mathbb{G}_m\). Based on this perspective, we developed a motivic interpretation of the de Rham-Witt complex using the theory of reciprocity sheaves.</p>

        <h3>4. Blow-up invariance of cohomology theories with modulus</h3>
        <p class="journal">Advances in Mathematics, Volume 458, Part B (2024), 109967. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14803">arXiv: 2306.14803</a></p>
        <p>The second part of my Ph.D. thesis. I proved the blow-up invariance for cohomology with modulus, a conjecture proposed by Kahn, Miyazaki, Saito, and Yamazaki, under mild assumptions. Since counterexamples exist if these assumptions are removed, I believe this is the best result one can hope for. It was a problem I had long wanted to solve, and surprisingly, one flash of insight led to the solution.</p>

        <h3>5. Quadratic residues and domino tilings (with Y. Kamio and T. Nakazawa)</h3>
        <p class="journal">Preprint. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13597">arXiv: 2311.13597</a></p>
        <p>My first elementary mathematics paper. Mr. Nakazawa, an acquaintance working in industry, made a striking observation: a resemblance between the Kasteleyn formula for domino tilings and Eisenstein’s formula related to quadratic residues. I formulated this as a precise identity and proved it jointly with Yuhi. I'm deeply happy to have discovered such a beautiful formula in my lifetime.</p>

        <p class="journal">Preprint. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19767">arXiv: 2407.19767</a></p>
        <p>Together with my brilliant friend Shuho, we solved an elementary problem listed in the Open Problems Garden. Shuho came up with a sharp and effective strategy for the proof, and I carefully carried it out step by step. It was fascinating to see the mysterious sequence known as the Lyness cycle naturally appear in the process.</p>

        <h3>7. Irreducibility of polynomials defining parabolic parameters of period 3 (with Y. Murakami, K. Sano, K. Takehira)</h3>
        <p class="journal">To appear in Acta Arith. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04850">arXiv: 2408.04850</a></p>
        <p>A paper on number-theoretic phenomena arising in dynamical systems. I read a preprint written by the other three authors and became intrigued by the Morton–Vivaldi conjecture presented in it. I reached out to them and was kindly invited to join the team. We had lively discussions every day through chat, making the collaboration both productive and enjoyable. In the end, we managed to completely resolve the case of period 3, which exceeded our initial expectations.</p>

        <h3>8. A note on the Erdős conjecture about square packing (with J. Baek and T. Ueoro)</h3>
        <p class="journal">Preprint. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07274">arXiv: 2411.07274</a></p>
        <p>Together with my friend Takahiro, who works in industry, we partially solved an elementary problem from the Erdős Problems collection. Takahiro, a gold medalist in the International Mathematical Olympiad, often solves difficult puzzles with brilliant intuition. In this case, he devised a clever proof for the case of 5 squares, and I generalized it to arbitrary numbers. After posting the paper on arXiv, we learned that Jineon had independently discovered a proof as well, so it became a joint paper among the three of us.</p>

        <h3>9. Isosceles trapezoids of unit area with vertices in sets of infinite planar measure</h3>
        <p class="journal">To appear in Proc. Am. Math. Soc. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01914">arXiv: 2501.01914</a></p>
        <p>I had been thinking about various problems from the Erdős Problems collection, hoping to solve one, and happened to hit upon an idea that led to a solution. I made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LC1mAJGmmU" target="_blank">video</a> in Japanese explaining the proof, which unexpectedly received a lot of attention from a general audience.</p>

        <h3>10. Motivic homotopy theory with ramification filtrations (with H. Miyazaki and S. Saito)</h3>
        <p class="journal">Preprint. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02223">arXiv: 2504.02223</a></p>
        <p>Our joint research started with the goal of linking the theory of reciprocity sheaves and the theory of motives with modulus. Along the way, we realized we could refine the modulus theory, and in the end we managed to build a good motivic homotopy category. I’m especially happy that the cohomology of any reciprocity sheaf is representable in our category. The proof of this uses the blow-up invariance that I proved in my PhD thesis.

        <h3>11. Irrationality of the reciprocal sum of doubly exponential sequences</h3>
        <p class="journal">Preprint. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05933">arXiv: 2504.05933</a></p>
        <p>I wanted to tackle another problem from the Erdős Problems list, but I ran into a significant obstacle. So I decided to write up the partial progress I had made. The conjecture I posed is extremely simple to state yet elusive and frustrating to grasp. It seems that solving it may require a completely new perspective.</p>

        <h3>12. A new upper bound for mutually touching infinite cylinders</h3>
        <p class="journal">Preprint. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19309">arXiv: 2506.19309</a></p>
        <p>When I had a meal with Tomoaki Abuku from NII, he told me about a problem: how many people can clink glasses at the same time if the glasses are cylindrical. I found it extremely intriguing. Ever since then, I had been thinking about whether the known upper bound of \(24\) could be improved, and in the spring of 2025, I came up with an idea using linear algebra that led to rapid progress. A suggestion from ChatGPT o4-mini-high helped me prove an important lemma. It was a moment when I truly felt the future of mathematical research.
